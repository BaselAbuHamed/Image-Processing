# Image Processing Project

This project is aimed at performing various image processing tasks using OpenCV and NumPy libraries in Python. It includes functions for converting images to grayscale, binary, and resizing, as well as performing operations such as histogram calculation, contrast enhancement, flipping, blurring, creating negative images, cropping, and finding the best matching strip in an image.

***

# Features

- **Convert to Grayscale:** Convert images to grayscale using the luminosity formula.
- **Convert to Binary:** Convert grayscale images to binary using thresholding.
- **Resize Images:** Resize images to specified dimensions using nearest-neighbor interpolation.
- **Calculate Metrics:** Compute metrics such as mean intensity, standard deviation, entropy, and histograms.
- **Enhance Contrast:** Enhance image contrast using histogram equalization.
- **Flip Images:** Flip images horizontally.
- **Blur Images:** Apply a blur filter to images.
- **Create Negative Images:** Generate negative images by inverting intensity values.
- **Crop Images:** Crop images to specified regions.
- **Find Best Matching Strip:** Find the best matching strip in an image based on histogram similarity.
